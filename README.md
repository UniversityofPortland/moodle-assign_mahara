# Mahara Assignment Submission Plugin

This repository houses an updated Mahara assignment submission plugin.

## Features

- XML-RPC integration with a Mahara installation
- Select portfolio
- If multiple submissions are allowed, it releases the previously selected submission
- Abides by Moodle assignments config options
- Popups for quickly previewing submissions (no windows... no tabs)

## Requirements

- Moodle 2.3+
- [Fully integrated Moodle -> Mahara instances][3]
- [Updated Mahara local plugin][1]
- [Mahara Feedback plugin][2] (Optional, but reccommended)

## Installation

Be sure that you have a version of Moodle that is equal or greater than 2.3. Also make sure you have successfully
integrated your Moodle installation with a Mahara instance.

Mahara has detailed documenation on how to achieve that [on their wiki][3]. Once you have done that, you must
install the [updated Mahara local plugin][1] on your Moodle installation. Then, install this plugin in one of two ways:

1. Download the source archive and extract its contents to the following location `{Moodle_Root}/mod/assign/submission/mahara`
2. Execute the following command:

```
> git clone git@github.com:fellowapeman/assign-mahara.git {Moodle_Root}/mod/assign/submission/mahara
```

The remainder of the install is taken care of by Moodle by clicking on _Notifcations_.

## Feedback plugin

The only reason the feedback plugin exists is for properly releasing graded submissions and for Mahara outcomes. It's an optional install because it's technically not required for a fully functional Mahara assignment, but it's certainly reccommeded.
